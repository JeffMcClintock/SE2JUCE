* There are two fundamental types of data streams in GMPI: audio data and
  control data.  Audio data is delivered via buffers of audio-rata samples.
  Each sample in an audio buffer is the same datatype - the GMPI audio sample
  datatype for the profile.  Control data is delivered via time-stamped
  events.  Each event may be one of several datatypes.

* A GMPI compliant platform must support static C++ objects in dynamically
  loaded and unloaded libraries.  This includes static objects in file
  scope, function scope and block scope.  For maximum portability, GMPI
  plugins should avoid using static C++ objects in function or block scopes.
  Some platforms are known to have problems unloading DLLs with static C++
  objects.

* When a plugin is created with IGMPI_Factory::CreateInstance(), the object
  returned (IGMPI_Unknown) is the plugin's "root object".  The root object
  may or may not be the same object that actually implements any given GMPI
  interfaces.  The host MUST use the QueryInterface() method to find the
  specific interface with which it is concerned.  The only GMPI interface
  which the root object MUST implement is IGMPI_IID_UNKNOWN.

  Similarly, the object passed to IGMPI_Factory::CreateInstance() as the
  host object (IGMPI_Unknown) is the host's root object.  The root object
  may or may not be the same object that actually implements any given GMPI
  interfaces.  The plugin MUST use the QueryInterface() method to find the
  specific interface with which it is concerned.  The only GMPI interface
  which the root object MUST implement is IGMPI_IID_UNKNOWN.

* For a given GUID, 'Plugin_IID', which identifies a plugin, the following
  must be true:
    - If the plugin's IGMPI_Factory::CreateInstance() method is called
      with the GUID argument Plugin_IID.  The instance created is
      returned in a pointer, 'p0'.
    - If the instance's IGMPI_Plugin::QueryInterface() method is called
      with the GUID argument Plugin_IID.  The interface pointer returned
      has the same value as p0.
    - If the instance's IGMPI_Plugin::QueryInterface() method is called
      with the GUID argument GMPI_IID_UNKNOWN.  The interface pointer
      returned has the same value as p0.
