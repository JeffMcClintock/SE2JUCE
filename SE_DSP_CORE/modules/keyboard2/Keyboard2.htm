<h2>Keyboard2</h2>
    <p>On screen keyboard.</p>
    <h3>MIDI</h3>
    <p>The Keyboard2 does not have a MIDI connection, it responds to MIDI indirectly via 
        the Patch-Automator module.&nbsp; It also sends MIDI out via the 
        Patch-Automator.</p>
<h2>Pins</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>VoiceAllocationMode/Item List </b>- Provides control over Polyphonic and 
        Monophonic modes. (see below).</li>
	<li><b>Note Priority/Item List</b> - Provides control over Monophonic note priority 
        modes.</li>
	<li><b>Glide Type</b></li>
	<li><b>Glide Rate</b></li>
	<li><b>Bend Range</b> - Sets range of Pitch Bender wheel.</li>
	<li><b>Pitch</b> - Controls oscillator and filter pitch.</li>
    <li><b>Trigger/Gate</b> - For controlling Envelope modules.</li>
	<li><b>Velocity</b></li>
	<li><b>Aftertouch</b></li>
	<li><b>Raw Pitch/Velocity</b> - Regular Pitch and Velocity pins are &#39;smoothed&#39; to 
        prevent clicks.&nbsp; These are useful for triggering multi-samples correctly.</li>
	<li><b>Polyphony </b>- How many notes can sound at one time.</li>
	<li><b>Polyphony Reserve</b> - How many voices are held in reserve to provide 
        glitch-free note-stealing. between 3 and 5 is optimum.</li>
</ul>
    <h3>
        Voice Allocation Modes</h3>
    <h2>
        Polyphonic Modes</h2>
    <p>
        These modes provide for normal polyphonic play.&nbsp; Each key is assigned it&#39;s 
        own Voice from the available pool. Where the modes differ is how they handle 
        repeat hits on the same key:</p>
    <p>
        <b>Poly</b> - The same voice is re-used. Much like mono mode, Envelopes do not 
        hard-reset to zero but start from current level. Usefull for synthesizing 
        keyboard instruments. e.g. Piano.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Poly Hard</b> - Each new note is allocated a fresh unused voice. 
        Envelopes always start from zero. The older voice is faded-out to prevent the old note&#39;s release tail from sounding &#39;under&#39; the new note.<br />
&nbsp;This mode is designed to prevent clicks during sample playback where the playback 
        position resets at the start of each note.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Poly Overlap </b>- Same as above. Except the older voice continues to sound 
        along with the new one.&nbsp; Useful for ensemble sounds like string sections 
        where several instruments can play the same note.</p>
    <h2>
        <b>Monophonc modes</b> </h2>
    <p>
        Monophonic modes provide only one voice, only one note can sound at one 
        time.&nbsp; Where the modes differ is how they handle overlapping (legato) 
        notes.</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;<b>Mono</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp; Envelopes do not hard-reset but continue from 
        current level. Overlapping (legato) notes blend into each other (Envelopes do 
        not restart). Good for synthesised monophonic instruments that can glide a 
        note&#39;s pitch like Cello.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Mono (Retrigger)</b> - Overlapping notes cause 
        Envelopes to restart the attack segment.&nbsp; Good for percussive instruments.</p>
